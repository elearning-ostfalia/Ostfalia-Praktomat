The Praktomat VM "Appliance" was created using http://www.virtualbox.org/

After importing the Praktomat Appliance,  do the following:
 1.) Start the  virtual machine and make sure an ip
     is assigned to it by your networks' dhcp server.

 2.) Login to the vm as "praktomat" using the
     VirtialBox Console or ssh. The password is 'foobar'

 3.) In the file
       ~/installations/default/Praktomat/src/settings_local.py
     change the following settings to match your network:
       BASE_URL
       EMAIL_*
       DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL
       ADMINS
       

     Make sure apache recognizes your changes:
       touch /home/praktomat/installations/default/Praktomat/bin/praktomat.wsgi 

 4.) Point your webbrowser to BASE_URL and enjoy!
